# kafka-wire

This project aims at providing typesafe communication over kafka, using protobuf as a communication mean, by leveraging the 
[services](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#services) feature from protobuf, [ScalaPB](https://trueaccord.github.io/ScalaPB/) to generate Scala code, and Li Haoyi's amazing  [autowire](https://github.com/lihaoyi/autowire) library.
